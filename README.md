# Quantitative Understanding of Epitope Specificity in T-cells (QUEST)

## Setup:

Notebooks in the repository look for the `tcr_llm` folder within the `data` folder. 
To run the notebooks, create a symbolic link to the `tcr_llm` folder using the following command

```{bash}
cd quest
ln -s <path to tcr_llm folder> data/tcr-llm
```

**Note:** Launch the jupyter server in the main `quest` directory.
